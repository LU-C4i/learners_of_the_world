One of the telling aspects is gaining more knowledge about Semantics and Pragmatics. I was able to use my learned knowledge of Pragmatics into practice use. Recently, I was in a mock proposal defence organized by my supervisor, and I was asked to provide feedback to the presentation given by a Ph.D. student. I found many pitfalls and shortcomings regarding the presentation of the presenter. I had no option but to inform the audience about the shortcomings of the presentation. Instead of going all out to the presenter with a volley of criticisms, I tried my best to tone down my pointed-out criticism towards the presenter. I started mentioning about the most updated/recent or state-of-the art topic in her field she was working on, and the investigation of the topic by her deserves a lot of appreciation. I gave her (the presenter) space and acknowledgement for her worth-while accomplishment she had undertaken. I saved her negative face. This is the learning I had from the Course: Miracles of Human Languages: An Introduction to Linguistics. I hope that this practical aspect of learning of Pragmatics has significant effect on me. From the interview with Noam Chomsky under the said course, I got to know how the Minimalist theory works in the field of Theoretical Linguistics, and his stand and voice always represent those who are marginalized against the prevalent theory among the larger or the majority of the linguistics around the world. These are the take-aways for me out of my learning in MOOC.</p><img src="/learners_of_the_world/images/CFI_logo.png" class="logo"><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-63205339-6', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview');</script><script src="/learners_of_the_world/js/theme.min.js"></script></body></html>
