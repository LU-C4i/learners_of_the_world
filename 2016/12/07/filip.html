I am currently studying law and working as an intern at Civil Rights Defenders. This summer I enrolled at the MOOC on the International Law in Action: A guide to the International courts and tribunals in the Hague because I wanted to learn more on the international justice system, its institutions and the way they are organized, their function, and their rule related to the current issues and challenges in the global environment. This MOOC really met my expectations in addressing these topics. I think the information was presented through nicely organized sessions, the video lectures were understandable, the reading materials and interviews were not only relevant but also very interesting, and the questions raised by the lecturers as well as in the discussions were thought provoking. Therefore, I could say that I did learn a great deal by this course, and I hope I will make use of this knowledge in my international law classes that I have to study this semester, as well as in my preparations for the ICJ Moot Court. Many thanks to the staff of Leiden University for making available such sessions of learning. I am really looking forward to enroll in future MOOCs, as well as to apply to Leiden University once I finish my undergraduate studies in law." /><meta property='og:description' content="I am Kristiana from Albania.
