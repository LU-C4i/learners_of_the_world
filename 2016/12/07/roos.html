Terrorism is real, but is also part of the perspective people have on the subject and is partly related to the moment they live in. The MOOC has nuanced the way I look at the subject. It helped me form my own opinion about the subject and taught me to take more variables in consideration than you might think of as first when you think or talk about terrorism. It teaches you to think less in stereotypes. For example: It’s not always ‘the poor’ who commit terrorist acts, also highly educated people who had plenty of opportunities are ‘capable’ of committing these acts. I use the knowledge I’ve gained from this course in my work as a researcher, for example it inspired me in finding new subjects to research, and also in conversations I have with people about the subject.
