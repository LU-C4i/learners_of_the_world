I got to know about the course, by accident. I was taking a unit on International Economic Law and my lecturer gave us the link to the first 3 videos of the RITL MOOC as recommended resources. Out of curiosity, I watched these videos. Within the first few minutes, I got entirely hooked by Professor Douma and Professor Simmontachi’s thorough and “user-friendly” presentations, not to mention Professor Kees Van Raad provocative ideas that got me thoroughly engaged and eager to learn more. The videos were short but full of relevant content. The material was very relevant as is the course. The grading was very fair. This course shaped my career ambition for I am very much interested in pursuing international tax law practice, and doing my masters (hopefully in Leiden)! Thank you for such a wonderful MOOC." /><meta property='og:description' content="I was greatly impressed by the standard of delivery of this course. I got to know about the course, by accident.
